# Orientation

This folder documents my initial orientation into cybersecurity as a field,
including terminology, role clarity, and how real-world cybersecurity work differs
from academic coursework.

## Why This Exists
I noticed early that formal education often explains *what* cybersecurity concepts are,
but not *how* they are used in real roles. This section is meant to bridge that gap.

## Key Questions I’m Exploring
- What do entry-level cybersecurity roles actually do day to day?
- What skills matter more than certifications?
- How security applies specifically to platforms, accounts, and games
- Where hands-on experience fits into hiring decisions

## Current Status
Orientation phase — February 2026
